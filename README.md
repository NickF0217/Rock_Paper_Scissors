Last April, I tried this project but couldn't get it to work exactly right. I went to look at some other examples from people who had finished, and that inspired me to reapply to college for accounting. That was a costly mistake, both financially and time. After re doing much of the odin project and FCC's basic JS course, I am going to finish this damned project this time.

Stuck on step 6, the game function. Otherwise, code has went smoothly. Attempted to create user interface and connect it to script as player selection, but failed. May work more on this later, but I will likely wait until Odin revisits the project. Will continue tomorrow. Or tonight.
